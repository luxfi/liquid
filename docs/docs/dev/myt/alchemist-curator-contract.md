# AlchemistAllocator

## Description

AlchemistCurator is the governance and configuration contract for MYT vaults. It allows admins and operators to register or remove strategy adapters for a given MYT and to adjust their absolute and relative caps. In short, it defines which strategies exist within the MYT and how much capital each can hold.<br/><br/>
**Note:** AlchemistCurator inherits from PermissionedProxy, which provides it's access control system for operator roles, and the deny-list used to restrict certain calls. The admin role is set using the same pending/admin admin system as the Alchemist and is handled in this child contract. For details on the operator role and logic, see PermissionedProxy.

## Variables

<details>
  <summary>adapterToMYT</summary>

  - **Description** - A mapping that associates each MYT strategy adapter address with the specific MYT vault address it is a part of. This is how the curator knows which vault to target when adding, removing, or adjusting caps for a given strategy.  
  - **Type** - `mapping(address => address)`  
  - **Used By**
    - [`_vault(address adapter)`](/dev/myt/alchemist-curator-contract#InternalOperations_vault)
    - [`_setStrategy(address adapter, address myt, bool remove)`](/dev/myt/alchemist-curator-contract#InternalOperations_setStrategy)
  - **Updated By**
    - `setStrategy(address adapter, address myt, bool remove)` - cannot use the zero address for the adapter or myt
  - **Read By**
    - `adapterToMYT(address)`
</details>
<details>
  <summary>pendingAdmin</summary>

- **Description** - The first step in a two-step process of setting a new administrator. The pendingAdmin is set by the current admin, then the pendingAdmin must accept the responsibility to lock in the change of admin.
- **Type** - address
- **Updated By**
  - [`transferAdminOwnership(address _newAdmin)`](/dev/myt/alchemist-curator-contract#AdminActions_transferAdminOwnerShip)
