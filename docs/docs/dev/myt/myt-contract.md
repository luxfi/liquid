The Liquid V3 protocol introduces a modular system for yield generation centered around Morpho V2 Vaults. The core of this system
is a set of strategies that function as adapters for the Morpho Vault, managing user-deposited assets such as WETH and USDC. These
strategies are designed to allocate capital across a diverse range of third-party, yield-bearing DeFi protocols. Users deposit their assets
into the Morpho Vault and receive Mix-Yield Tokens (MYT), which represent a share of the vault’s underlying assets. The value of an MYT
share is designed to increase over time as the strategies accrue yield. The allocation of capital is managed by an Liquid admin or
operator via the LiquidAllocator contract to optimize returns and manage risk.

This MYTStrategy contract is the base contract from which all individual strategy adapters are derived. Each adapter defines one of the many strategies used by the same MYT.
This base contract defines the functions that allow allocation and deallocation into the strategy, in addition to claiming and withdrawing, and other general operations on the strategy.
For more specific operations tailored to individual strategies, see the contract specs in /strategies section of the docs. (coming soon)

  - `@param prevSettler` - Boolean flag indicating whether to use the previous Settler contract (`true`) or the current one (`false`).

  First ensures that the `MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL` has passed since the last call to prevent griefing, then calls internal functions `_computeBaseRatePerSecond()` and `_computeRewardsRatePerSecond()`, both of which are implemented in derived contracts, to calculate the most up-to-date current rates. Then those rates are combined and projected out a year. A smoothign rate of .7 is then applied, and passed with the newly calculated rates to the internal `_lerp()` function to calculate estimated rates from the new snapshot and the previously snaphshotted rate.
