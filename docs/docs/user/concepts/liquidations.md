Liquidations in Liquid v3 are a system-wide safety valve, not a per-account punishment. Because loans and collateral are like-kind, with ETH backing alETH and USDC backing alUSD, market price swings do **not** force positions to close. The back-stop only activates if the Mix-Yield Token itself loses backing.

## When liquidation does not occur

| Event                              | Effect on your loan                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ETH or USDC price volatility       | None, debt and collateral move together.                          |
| alAsset drifting below peg on DEXs | None, protocol still values alAssets at face value for repayment. |
| Hitting the 90% LTV borrowing cap  | Borrowing stops, the position stays open and keeps earning yield. |

## What can trigger liquidation

| Event                                                 | Detection Method                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strategy loss, exploit, or severe slippage inside MYT | Oracle shows MYT NAV is less than system debt.                   |
| Position exceeds liquidation threshold (95% LTV)      | Oracle shows collateral value vs. debt ratio breaching threshold |

## How the process works

- **Max LTV** – If a position exceeds the max LTV (currently set at 95%), it is eligible for liquidations.

- **Partial liquidation only** – The protocol liquidates only the amount required to adjust the user’s position back to the defined target LTV, currently set at 85%.

- **Multi-step liquidations** – If a position can be made healthy by simply triggering a redemption early, then that is all that will happen and the liquidator will receive a small fee. Otherwise, the early redemption will occur and then the user’s collateral will be used to repay debt, along with a fee paid to the liquidator, down to the target LTV.

- **Liquidator Fee Vault** – Should the user’s collateral not be sufficient on its own to pay a liquidator, there is a separate fee vault that may be funded by any entity (including the DAO) that may be drawn from to pay liquidators.

## Reading the health bar

The colored bar in the vault UI gives an at-a-glance view of three numbers:

- **Current LTV** – your live leverage, updated in real time.

- **Max LTV** – the borrowing ceiling on the vault. You cannot mint alAssets beyond this green marker.

- **Liq LTV** – the red marker shows the liquidation threshold right now. If MYT ever records a loss, the marker slides left to reflect the reduced backing. If your current LTV remains below this marker, you will not be liquidated.

Day-to-day most users will never see a liquidation. If MYT vaults experience a loss, these mechanisms ensure losses are covered in a transparent and proportional way.

Users are encouraged to study the makeup of the MYT, as well as the risk categories. The DAO sets a maximum % of the MYT that may be allocated to high and medium risk categories. This allows users to set LTVs below liquidation thresholds based on those makeups.
