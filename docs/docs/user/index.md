### QUICK START:

Liquid is your unified platform for saving, earning, borrowing, and fixed-term fixed-yield opportunities—all in one place. Built on years of iteration since launching the original self-repaying loan in 2021, Liquid v3 brings all three pillars together with a smarter, more flexible design. The protocol allows you to:

- **Save and grow –** deposit ETH or USDC and let our vault invest and earn yield across diversified strategies.

- **Borrow up to 90% LTV –** access liquidity now while your collateral grows with yield and your leverage is reduced over time through scheduled redemptions. No interest rates to monitor, no price-based liquidations.

- **Earn fixed-rate yield –** lock in predictable returns through fixed-term redemptions of alETH or alUSD.

## 1. Grow Savings with Vaults

**How it works**

Deposit ETH or USDC into a vault to receive Mix-Yield Tokens (MYT). Each MYT represents a share of a portfolio of yield strategies chosen by Liquid and is rebalanced over time. Yield accrues continuously and is reflected in the redemption value of MYT.

### Key Points

|             |                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Asset types | ETH, USDC                                    |
| Strategy    | Diversified, tuned for risk-adjusted returns |
| Lock-up     | None, withdraw at any time                   |

## 2. Access Credit with Self-Repaying Loans

Need liquidity but don’t want to sell your assets? Borrow Liquid’s synthetic counterpart of your deposit and let your future yield repay the balance.

| Maximum LTV      | 90% of deposited collateral                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Liquidations     | Liquidations only apply if the MYT value drops below your loan value **plus a buffer**. This occurs if a strategy returns a negative yield or, for example, a strategy gets hacked. Your ETH or USD is deposited into the MYT and the MYT becomes your collateral. Learn more. |
| Early Repayment  | Optional at any time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Typical uses include financing a purchase, leveraging/looping yield, or bridging short-term opportunities without disrupting long-term holdings.

## 3. Lock In Fixed Returns with the Transmuter

The Transmuter lets users deposit alAssets and, after a fixed term, redeem an equivalent amount of the underlying asset—via Mix-Yield Tokens (MYT), which act as an intermediary claim.

- **Predictable returns** – redemption price and date are known upfront.
- **Peg stability** – arbitrage incentives help to keep alAssets near parity.
- **Protection for LPs** – stable asset prices and redemption opportunities help offset impermanent loss.

**Example**: If alUSD trades at 0.98 USDC and the current redemption period is three months, purchasing alUSD and redeeming it yields an annualised return of roughly 8%.

Under normal conditions, the interface unwraps that MYT to the underlying token for you. If liquidity is momentarily tight **or has unexpected slippage**, the contract may return the MYT itself. You can either hold it until unwrapping is available or unwrap manually once the queue clears.
