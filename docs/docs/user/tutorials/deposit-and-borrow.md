A single vault deposit gives you immediate, auto-compounded yield through the Mix-Yield Token (MYT). From there you can:

- **Stop after the deposit** – keep earning passive yield, zero management required.

- **Continue to the borrow step** – mint alAssets and tap into self-repaying loans.

The instructions that follow are focused on the process of depositing assets and borrowing alAssets subsequently.

## Prerequisites

- Connect your wallet and switch to the chain that holds the assets you plan to deposit.

* Confirm you have ETH for gas on that chain.

## Step 1 – Open the Vaults page

- From any screen choose Vaults in the top navigation, or;

- On the Dashboard (pictured above) click the empty tile with a plus icon next to your existing positions.

## Step 2 – Find the vault you want

- Use the icon filters (chain and asset) or the Sort by dropdown to narrow the list.

- Click a vault card to open its detail page.

## Step 3 – Choose Deposit/Borrow

The lower-left panel has three tabs:

1. Deposit / Borrow (default)

2. Withdraw

3. Repay

Stay on Deposit / Borrow.

## Step 4 – Enter amounts

Type the deposit size in the left box, then set the alAsset amount you plan to borrow. As you adjust the fields, keep an eye on three on-screen guides:

- **LTV meter** – in the main context window, a colored bar shows your live and maximum loan-to-value. The hard cap (90%) or current cap is marked by a red line. To avoid liquidations, keep your LTV below the indicated liquidation level, the further the better.

- **Strategy mix** – under Strategy Info, you can view the pie-chart of active strategies and their respective risk profiles.

- **Strategy ceilings** – in the same window, you’ll see the DAO-set maximum share percentage for each strategy that makes up the MYT vault. Therefore, there is a maximum allowed % of high risk strategies in each bucket.

Enter the amount of the vault’s deposit asset you want to add, and the amount of alAsset you wish to borrow.

## Step 5 – Queue or send

- Click Deposit or Borrow to submit a single action, or;

- Click the cart icon to bundle both actions. Bundling sends one on-chain transaction instead of two to complete both actions.

## Step 6 – Review and confirm

Your wallet pops up the transaction details. Check network, gas estimate, and amounts, then approve.

## Step 7 – Track your position

Back on the Dashboard you will see:

- Current collateral

- Outstanding debt

- Loan-to-value ratio

- Redemption queue status (if any)
